## Description

The Employee Manager app was made for companies to be able to track their departments, roles, and employees, as well as other factors like managers, salaries, etc. This app utilizes MySQL to store and use the data of the company to display its employyes, managers, roles, salaries, and departments. This project helped me get confortable using MySQL and mysql2. It helped me practice using different types of queries and pushed me to do research on different queries and learn how they work and how they can be used in the real world.

## Installation

This application is a terminal application which uses Node.js to run. The first step is to install Node.js. Once Node.js is installed in the user's computer they will have to clone the repo, and open it, once opened the user must open the terminal and install all dependencies by running the command:

```
npm install

```

Once installed the app can be ran by using the command:

```
 node ./index.js

```

## Usage

This application can be used by any type of company who desires to keep their employees, departments, and roles stored in a way where they can be easily displayed when needed.

## Contribution

The app is almost done, I would like to finish the app on my own but any sort of advice as to how to refractor the code would be much appreciated as I did notice that the code can be greatly reduced.

## Testing

There are no test in the app but the user can check for functionality by running the app themselves as shown in the instructions above.
